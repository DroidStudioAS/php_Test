## Project Features

### Juice Container System
The project includes a JuiceContainer class that handles juice overflow realistically. When processing large quantities of fruits (e.g., 100 fruits), the juice is automatically transferred to a storage container when the juicer becomes full. This prevents process interruption and simulates real-world juice production more accurately.

### Simulation Commands

1. Standard Simulation:

2. Custom Simulation:

The custom simulation command allows you to define your own parameters rather than using hardcoded values. This gives you flexibility to test different scenarios with varying numbers of juicing cycles.
